A reconstruction of University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s College Hall, in a magical, atmospheric winter setting. Done for the SIG lab&rsquo;s Holiday Card.
More WIP renders on my ArtStation
The most fun aspect of this project was modeling it: I took my learnings from my previous Deconstruction render and focused on modeling each wall brick and each roof tile.
Personally, I think that a huge aspect of believability comes from irregularities."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://mmerchante.github.io/projects/art/magical-moments/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=../../../assets/css/stylesheet.css rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=../../../assets/js/highlight.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
